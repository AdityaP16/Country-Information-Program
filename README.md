# Country Information Program
A program that allows you to enter a Country into the prompt and displays different statistics about the country. Built using python and utilizes many aspects of matplotlib in order to generate various statistical graphs for any country. This has been done by designing a terminal-based Python app which selects, imports, and manipulates a set of data using numpy arrays.
We processed user input data and displayed data using matplotlib.

Created using Python.
